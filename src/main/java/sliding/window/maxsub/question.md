### Question 1


A weather station monitors the daily temperature changes over a period of time. Each day's temperature change is recorded as a float, where positive values indicate an increase in temperature, and negative values indicate a decrease.

Find the maximum sum of temperature changes over a continuous sub-period. This sub-period can consist of both increases and decreases. The input period and sub-period considered for the solution should consist of a minimum of one day.

#### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`dailyTemperatureChanges = [1, 6.25, -12, 8.7]`

**Output:**  
`8.7`

#### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`dailyTemperatureChanges = [2.1, 3.62, -1.78, 2, -9, 4.6]`

**Output:**  
`5.94`
