### **How to Prepare for a Software Engineer Interview**

#### **Invest some time & effort preparing:**

1. **Master Big O**  
   Big O is the language we use to understand if our optimizations are useful. If you don’t understand it, it’s more difficult to optimize well.

2. **Pick your favorite language**  
   Choose a programming language you're comfortable with and focus on that during your preparation.

3. **Implement core data structures & algorithms from scratch**  
   Building data structures and algorithms from scratch will deepen your understanding and help you apply them effectively in interviews.

4. **Practice on real interview questions**  
   (Don’t just memorize algorithms.) Instead of rote memorization, focus on solving problems that you might encounter during an actual interview.

5. **Practice coding in the “real” environment**  
   Use a computer with a simple text editor to simulate the interview environment as closely as possible. This means typing out code and testing it manually, as you might need to during the interview.

#### **Push Yourself!**

- **Problems can be hard. Embrace the challenge!**  
  Interview questions are problem-solving exercises. So, some of the problems will be challenging—that’s the point! Embrace the challenge and push through.

### **What to Expect During the Interview**

1. **A few minutes of convo around your prior experience**  
   The interview usually starts with a brief discussion about your past work and experiences.

2. **Then 1 - 2 coding / problem-solving problems**  
   Expect to spend most of the time solving coding problems.

3. **Questions from you to the interviewer**  
   You’ll have an opportunity to ask questions, so prepare some in advance.

### **Interview Process Breakdown**

1. **Interviewer asks a question**  
   The interviewer will present a problem for you to solve.

2. **Ask clarifying questions, if any. Consider restating the problem.**  
   If the problem isn't clear, ask questions. Restating the problem ensures you've understood it correctly.

3. **Kick it off! Try to come up with something. It doesn’t have to be good.**  
   Start by writing a basic solution. It’s okay if it’s not perfect initially.

    - **Improve your algorithm**  
      If your first algorithm is slow or doesn’t work perfectly, don’t worry. Work on optimizing it or fixing any issues.

4. **Code**  
   Write out the code for your solution. Your interviewer might have you code a slower solution first and then optimize it, or you might optimize first and then code. Talk to your interviewer about when to code.

5. **Verify that your code works**  
   Yes, you can verify your code without running it! Plug in values and walk through your code. We’ll show you how this works.

### **What They’re Looking For**

- **Problem-solving skills**
- **Eagerness to tackle challenges**
- **Coding skills. Well-written. Good style. Correct. (Not necessarily flawless.)**
- **Communication & collaboration**

They don’t expect—or want—you to just “know” the answer to questions. If you do know the answer immediately because you’ve heard the question before, let the interviewer know.

### **Final Note**

**Your perception of how you’re doing isn’t reflective of reality.**  
If you think you’re doing poorly, this is because the problem is challenging. But it might be challenging for everyone! Just keep working at it.
