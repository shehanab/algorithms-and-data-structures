Here's a concise guide to help you polish up your knowledge of important data structures and collections in Java 8. This guide focuses on key points, common usage scenarios, and some nuances specific to Java 8.

### 1. **Arrays**
- **Fixed Size**: Once initialized, the size of an array cannot change.
- **Access**: Direct access via index makes it fast (O(1) for reading/writing).
- **Usage**: Best for storing a fixed number of elements when you know the size in advance.

### 2. **ArrayList**
- **Dynamic Size**: Resizable array, grows automatically as you add elements.
- **Access Time**: O(1) for getting or setting elements by index.
- **Insertions/Deletions**: O(n) in the worst case, due to potential resizing or shifting.
- **Usage**: Ideal for lists that require frequent random access and occasional insertions/removals.

### 3. **LinkedList**
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each element points to its previous and next elements.
- **Access Time**: O(n) for getting an element by index.
- **Insertions/Deletions**: O(1) for adding/removing at the beginning or end, O(n) elsewhere.
- **Usage**: Suitable for scenarios where you need constant-time insertions or deletions at the cost of slower access.

### 4. **HashMap**
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Stores data in key-value pairs; keys must be unique.
- **Access Time**: O(1) for put/get operations in the average case.
- **Collisions**: Handled using chaining (linked lists within the bucket) or probing.
- **Load Factor**: Default load factor is 0.75, which balances time and space complexity.
- **Usage**: Ideal for situations requiring quick lookups by key.

### 5. **TreeMap**
- **Sorted Order**: Keys are stored in a Red-Black Tree, maintaining natural or custom order.
- **Access Time**: O(log n) for get, put, and remove operations.
- **Usage**: Useful when you need sorted key-value pairs and efficient range queries.

### 6. **HashSet**
- **Unique Elements**: Stores unique elements with no duplicates allowed.
- **Underlying Structure**: Backed by a HashMap, with elements being keys.
- **Access Time**: O(1) for add, remove, and contains operations in the average case.
- **Usage**: Suitable when the uniqueness of elements is required without any specific order.

### 7. **TreeSet**
- **Sorted Order**: Like TreeMap, TreeSet maintains elements in a sorted order using a Red-Black Tree.
- **Access Time**: O(log n) for add, remove, and contains operations.
- **Usage**: Ideal for scenarios where you need a sorted set of elements.

### 8. **PriorityQueue**
- **Heap Implementation**: Typically implemented as a binary heap.
- **Natural Ordering**: Elements are ordered according to their natural ordering or by a comparator provided at the time of construction.
- **Operations**: O(log n) for insertion and removal.
- **Usage**: Suitable for tasks like scheduling where you need access to the smallest (or largest) element.

### 9. **Deque (ArrayDeque and LinkedList)**
- **Double-Ended Queue**: Allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends.
- **ArrayDeque**: Faster than LinkedList for most cases; doesn’t allow null elements.
- **LinkedList**: Deque implementation that can be used when you need a LinkedList’s benefits.
- **Usage**: Useful for implementing stacks and queues, especially when both operations at the head and tail are needed.

### 10. **Stack**
- **LIFO (Last In First Out)**: Supports push, pop, peek operations.
- **Legacy Class**: While still widely used, consider using `Deque` (specifically `ArrayDeque`) for stack operations instead, due to better performance.
- **Usage**: Best for situations requiring last-in-first-out order.

### 11. **Queue**
- **FIFO (First In First Out)**: Main operations are `add` (or `offer`), `remove` (or `poll`), and `peek`.
- **Implementations**: `LinkedList`, `PriorityQueue`, `ArrayDeque`.
- **Usage**: Useful in scenarios like task scheduling or handling requests in the order they arrive.

### 12. **Concurrent Collections (Java.util.concurrent)**
- **ConcurrentHashMap**: Thread-safe version of HashMap, designed for highly concurrent environments.
    - **Segmented Locks**: Reduces lock contention compared to `Hashtable`.
- **CopyOnWriteArrayList/CopyOnWriteArraySet**: Thread-safe collections where all mutative operations result in a new copy of the underlying array.
    - **Usage**: Ideal for cases where reads are frequent and modifications are rare.
- **BlockingQueue**: Supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty/full when retrieving/adding an element.
    - **Usage**: Common in producer-consumer scenarios.

### 13. **Iterable and Stream API**
- **Iterable Interface**: Implemented by all collection classes. Provides an iterator to traverse the collection.
- **Stream API**: Introduced in Java 8, allows functional-style operations on streams of elements.
    - **Key Methods**: `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `collect`, `forEach`.
    - **Parallel Streams**: Leverage multi-core architectures for parallel processing.

### 14. **Common Algorithms and Practices**
- **Sorting**: `Collections.sort(List)` or `List.sort(Comparator)` for in-place sorting.
- **Searching**: `Collections.binarySearch(List, key)` for binary search (requires sorted list).
- **Equals and HashCode**: Always override `equals()` and `hashCode()` when using objects as keys in a `HashMap` or elements in a `HashSet`.

### 15. **Performance Considerations**
- **Memory Overhead**: Choose the right data structure based on memory constraints (e.g., LinkedList vs. ArrayList).
- **Access Patterns**: Consider typical operations (e.g., random access vs. sequential) to choose between different collections.
- **Thread Safety**: For multi-threaded environments, prefer `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, or `synchronized` wrappers.

This guide should provide you with a solid foundation for your pair programming interview. Focus on understanding the trade-offs and typical use cases for each data structure, and you'll be well-prepared. Good luck!
